Please add your pseudocode to this file

function getConsecutiveSubstrings(input):
    result = []                     // Initialize an empty array to store substrings
    for i from 0 to length of input - 1:
        substring = ""              // Start with an empty substring
        for j from i to length of input - 1:
            substring += input[j]   // Append the current character
            add substring to result
    return result

And a written explanation of your solution

Outer loop sets the starting index of the substring.

Inner loop grows the substring from the start index one character at a time.

Each substring is pushed into the result array.
